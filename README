This project was tested on Ubuntu 12.04

FILE MANIFEST:

*Header files:
	sjf.h - This header file contains function protocols, definitions and a process struct

*C files:
	sjf.c - An attempt at pre-emptive shortest job first process scheduling.

*Other:
	testdata.dat, testdata2.dat - Symbolic representation of processes
				      and their IO/CPU burst cycles
	
HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
To compile:
$ gcc sjf.c -o ShortestJobFirst
In order to run, you must type ./ShortestJobFirst [filename]. If one of the test data files are not passed, the program will exit.

ISSUES?
Yeah, I have no idea if this is accurate or fully functioning!!!!
